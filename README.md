# collections_project

This project is a work-in-progress and I plan to implement the following updates:

1. Users will be able to log in to a user account that holds their personal details and information.
2. The styling and colour scheme will be updated as this is a very brief draft of the desired product. 
3. Each column represents a table in the database. In future, each column will have a button that opens a modal containing all the scrollable data and contents within that table. This would allow a better and simplified design on the main dashboard of 3 blocks that each open up to show the saved information.
4. Responsive styling of different screen sizes will be implemented in future.
5. I would like to add an admin login for UI so that customer transactions, payment plans and customer notes can be added and updated by the admin.
