# collections_project

This project is a work-in-progress. I plan to implement the following updates:

1. Users will be able to log in to a user account that holds their personal details and information.
2. The styling and colour scheme will be updated as this is a very brief draft of the desired product. 
3. Each column represents a table in the database. In future, each column will have a button that opens a modal containing all the scrollable data and contents within that table. This would allow a better and simplified design on the main dashboard - 3 blocks and each open up to show the saved information within each table.
4. Responsive styling of different screen sizes will be implemented in future.
5. I would like to add an admin login for UI so that the business has a simple way to add, update and delete customer transactions, payment plans and customer notes. This will be implemented so that all CRUD criteria can be carried out on the UI, not only the backend.
